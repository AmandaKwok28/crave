## Team Agreement

## Team Values

- Each team member is responsible and accountable for upholding our collaboration values as we work together to improve teamwork and communication. We will hold each other accountable when someone does not act in accordance with this agreement.
- All team members are expected to attend meetings and classes on time and come prepared as agreed upon. For the team to succeed, members must be responsible for their assigned tasks and complete the required work. Failure to do so could hinder team progress, especially if subsequent steps depend on the completed work. Everyone should be able to rely on their team members to fulfill their responsibilities so that the team can achieve its objectives.
- Regardless of their role, everyone is expected to support one another and take responsibility for the overall quality of all project deliverables. There may be different opinions on how to achieve success within the team, so members should be open to compromise and understand that it is sometimes more important to find a solution than to be "right."
- Each member should actively listen to others and provide effective, non-judgmental feedback. Members are responsible for expressing their ideas, thoughts, and concerns. Respecting cultural and personal differences and engaging in respectful communication, both verbal and non-verbal, contributes to team cohesion.
- We are committed to addressing differences in a timely, open, and honest manner. It is important to address conflicts before they become destructive. When an issue arises, we aim to resolve it at the level where it occurred by speaking directly to the individuals involved in the conflict before involving a third-party mediator such as a manager (CA or instructor).

## Team Communication

- Developers will have weekly internal meetings to discuss goals, updates, and blockers. These meetings will occur on Saturdays from 1-4PM, virtual or in-person as necessary. Additionally, developers will have a weekly meeting with advisor/instructor to discuss the project‚Äôs status.
- Project ideation, documentation, meeting notes, and trackers will be hosted on Notion, for ease of access.
- Everyone is expected to actively participate in team meetings. If unable to attend a meeting, advance notice should be given. If a team member misses a meeting, they should follow up within 12 hours to check if there are any pending tasks.
- At the beginning of each iteration, an availability schedule will be provided. Team members will be available for deployment/delivery outside regular class hours or on weekends.
- Slack will be the primary communication tool, while texting via cell phone will be used for urgent correspondence.
- A response on Slack is expected within 12 hours. If a response is not received in time, the person responsible will buy coffee for everyone!
    - Use the üëç emoji to indicate agreement or acknowledgment.
    - Engage in a conversation in a dedicated thread (click "Reply to thread") for questions, comments, objections, etc.
    - Use the ‚úÖ emoji to show that action has been taken in response to a thread.
- Any issues that may prevent the completion of assigned tasks should be proactively communicated.
